# MATLAB-arrowR3

This provides a MATLAB function for drawing 3D arrows.

There is an existing 3D arrow function, arrow3(), available on the MATLAB exchange. Here, I find that it can be difficult to interpret the direction of the arrows because they are monochromatic. I authored this function because I wanted arrows that are more clearly and readily interpreted. I based my code on Changshun Deng's arrow3d() from August 30, 2005. arrow3d() no longer seems to be supported on MATLAB.

You can compare the output of arrow3() and arrowR3() by examining the *.mp4 videos I included. These movies were created using "time_evolution.m".

You also can see basic examples of arrowR3() in the file "test_myarrowR3.m".
